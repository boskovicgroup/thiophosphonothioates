This repository pertains to the Boskovic research group publication "Thiophosphonothioates from Oxiranes" submitted to Tetrahedron Letters in October 2025. 

The folder "computational_files" contains the GAMESS and Gaussian output files for ground state structures of four thiophosphonothioates derived from styrene oxides, their predicted NMR shielding tensors, as well as the transition state and the intrinsic reaction coordinates for coupling between the styrene oxide and Lawesson's reagent monomer.

The folder "relevant_NMR_spectra" contains the .png and the MestReNova processed NMR spectra (1D and 2D) that were the basis of the structure assignment in the above-referenced publication. 

The folder "X_ray" contains the .cif file, .png image of the crystal, the details of the X-ray diffraction procedure, and the CIF check document.
